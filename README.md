# AI Workflow Orchestrator

AI Workflow Orchestrator is an **AI-powered code review system** designed to help developers automatically analyze, review, and improve code. It not only generates suggestions but can intelligently merge changes and store all code submissions and revisions in a **SQLite database** for tracking and future reference. This makes it a comprehensive solution for code quality management and version tracking.

## Overview

The project acts as an **intelligent assistant** that streamlines the process of reviewing code. It is especially useful in collaborative environments, CI/CD pipelines, or personal development workflows where tracking improvements and maintaining a history of code changes is essential. The orchestrator ensures that code reviews are **consistent, efficient, and properly stored** for future reference.

## How It Works

The workflow of AI Workflow Orchestrator can be broken down into the following steps:

### 1. **Code Submission**
- Developers submit their code snippets, files, or entire modules to the system.
- The code can be read from files or passed programmatically to the orchestrator.

### 2. **Automated Code Review**
- AI agents analyze the submitted code to detect:
  - Syntax or logical errors
  - Code inefficiencies
  - Poor coding practices or style issues
  - Optimization opportunities
- The agents generate **suggestions for improvements** based on the analysis.

### 3. **Merging Suggestions**
- The orchestrator can automatically **merge the suggested improvements** into the original code.
- Conflicts or overlapping suggestions are handled intelligently.
- The merged code maintains the original functionality while improving readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.
- Developers can optionally review the merged code before finalizing changes.

### 4. **Database Storage**
- Every submission, suggestion, and merged result is stored in a **SQLite database**.
- The database keeps track of:
  - Original code
  - AI-generated suggestions
  - Merged code
  - Timestamps for each operation
- This allows developers to **query past revisions**, track improvements over time, and maintain a history of code evolution.

## Key Components

1. **AI Agents**
   - Responsible for analyzing code and generating suggestions.
   - Can be extended to support multiple programming languages or specific code standards.
   - Modular design allows addition of new agents without modifying the core orchestrator.

2. **Orchestrator Core**
   - Manages the workflow between code submission, review, suggestion merging, and storage.
   - Coordinates multiple AI agents and ensures smooth execution of tasks.

3. **SQLite Database**
   - Stores all code versions, suggestions, and merged results.
   - Provides query functionality to retrieve previous submissions and review history.
   - Lightweight and easy to deploy, requiring no additional setup.

4. **Merge Engine**
   - Combines AI-generated suggestions with original code.
   - Resolves conflicts intelligently to maintain functionality.
   - Ensures that merged code follows best practices.

## Features

- **Automated Code Review**: Provides AI-based suggestions for improvements.
- **Intelligent Merge**: Automatically integrates suggestions into the original code.
- **History Tracking**: Stores all code submissions, reviews, and merged versions in SQLite.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add new agents, rules, or languages easily.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Reduces manual code review effort and maintains structured code history.

## Purpose and Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive code review tasks.  
- **Consistency**: Ensures code adheres to best practices and standards.  
- **Traceability**: Maintains a full history of code submissions and improvements.  
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple code submissions or agents simultaneously.  
- **Collaboration**: Useful in team projects or CI/CD pipelines for consistent automated reviews.

## Summary

AI Workflow Orchestrator is a **centralized system for automated code review and management**. By combining AI analysis, intelligent merging, and structured SQLite storage, it helps developers maintain high code quality, track improvements over time, and reduce manual effort. It acts as both a **smart code assistant** and a **persistent code review database**, making code workflows more efficient and reliable.
